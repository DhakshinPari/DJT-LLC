Twitter bot which uses publicly available information of the top 25 U.S. congressional persons, in which we will be tracking their stock portfolio. In simple terms, we will send out a notification or tweet, displaying the latest buy or sell of a stock by these polticians. The tweet will include the company name, including a JPG of the companies logo, how many shares were bought and for what price, as well as a JPG of the Congressional person.
